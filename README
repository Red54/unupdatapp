unupdatapp
==========

(C) 2012 Guillermo Guti√©rrez.
Based on the work by ZeBadger available at [1], and before: by McSpoon [2].

This program is made up for to unpack and repack `UPDATA.APP' files from huawei
android-based devices stock roms.

Work is in progress, and any type of collaboration is welcomed. You can
find me at <xiterrex@gmail.com>, or [3].

License is GPLv3 as you can see in the file COPYING.

= Testing the code =

You can drop a sample `UPDATA.APP' to `tests/' directory, and then, runing the
`make check' target will test the program itself, first against the original
`split_updata.pl' program, and afterwards, repacking the unpacked file and
test for it equality.
